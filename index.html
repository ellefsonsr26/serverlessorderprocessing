    <h1>Welcome to our home page</h1>
    <p>Founded in 2024 by a group of budget-conscious college eggheads, Shouldn’t Cost More Than A Pizza was born out of a simple belief: everyone deserves restaurant-quality food without the restaurant price tag. Dissatisfied with the high prices of cloud computing services and the compromises of cheaper options, the founders set out to create the perfect frozen pizza—packed with high-quality ingredients, bold flavors, and a price point that "shouldn't cost more than a pizza." From the humble beginnings of a small computer lab operation, the brand is quickly growing, resonating with people looking for affordable indulgence. Today, Shouldn’t Cost More Than A Pizza delivers a blossoming range of gourmet frozen pizzas and complementary sides, all designed to make every meal a treat without breaking the bank.</p>
