    <h1>Welcome to Shouldn't Cost More Than A Pizza's Home Page!</h1>
    <p id="special-paragraph">Founded in 2024 by a group of budget-conscious college eggheads, Shouldn’t Cost More Than A Pizza was born out of a simple belief: everyone deserves restaurant-quality food without the restaurant price tag.<br>Dissatisfied with the high prices of cloud computing services and the compromises of cheaper options, the founders set out to create the perfect frozen pizza—packed with high-quality ingredients, bold flavors, and a price point that "shouldn't cost more than a pizza."<br>From the humble beginnings of a small computer lab operation, the brand is quickly growing, resonating with people looking for affordable indulgence.<br>Today, Shouldn’t Cost More Than A Pizza delivers a blossoming range of gourmet frozen pizzas and complementary sides, all designed to make every meal a treat without breaking the bank.</p>
